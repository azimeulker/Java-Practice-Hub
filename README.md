# Java Practice Repository
This repository contains a collection of Java programming exercises and problems to help me improve and sharpen my Java coding skills. Each exercise is organized into its own folder and includes a description of the problem and my solution.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to give me a space to continue practicing Java programming and to review and reinforce the concepts I learned in my Programming-1 class.
